# Option Replicating Portfolio with Neural-Networks
How to hedge an Option using Monte-Carlo and Neural Networks

The 2 steps that this project is divided into are:
- Advanced Monte-Carlo technique of Quasi-Monte Carlo (Sobol) for the path simulation of the stock.
- After we calculate the option's payoff at time T. How we can create a replicating portfolio strategy to value the option at t=0.
